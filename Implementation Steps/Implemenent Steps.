Step 0:
Get DataSet :

We use the [FER-2013 Faces Database](http://www.socsci.ru.nl:8180/RaFD2/RaFD?p=main), a set of 28,709 pictures of people displaying 7 emotional expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, surprised and neutral). **The dataset quality and image diversity is not very good and you will probably get a model with bad accuracy in other applications!**

Download `fer2013.tar.gz` and decompress `fer2013.csv` in the `./data` folder.

Step 1:
 Dependencies :

-> Activate environment
-> pip install -r requirements.txt

step 2:
 CSV to numpy conversion:

The data is in CSV and we need to transform it using the script `csv_to_numpy.py` that generates the image and label data in the `data` folder.

->python3 csv_to_numpy.py

Step 3:
Train the model.

-> python3 emotion_recognition.py train

Step 4 : 
Real Time

-> python3 emotion_recognition.py poc
